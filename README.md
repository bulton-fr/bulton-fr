Hi, I'm a **Senior Web Developer**, primarily backend-focused with strong expertise in PHP (I'm ok to use another back-end language if needed). I also work full-stack when needed and enjoy tackling technical challenges with a user-centric approach. My key focus areas include:  

- **API development** (SOAP, REST) to streamline integrations and simplify operations.  
- **Performance optimization**, ensuring applications remain fast and efficient.  
- **Scalable architecture design**, creating modular and maintainable systems.  
- **Mentoring & knowledge sharing**, helping teams improve through best practices.  

A lot of my projects are private on GitHub and GitLab, which explains why my activity seem lower than expected.  
Also my public projects were put on hold during my freelance years, where client work took priority. With a career shift, Iâ€™m gradually reviving and updating them.  
This includes modernizing stacks, refining CI/CD processes, and improving overall maintainability.  

I mainly use these techno :

### **Addons for The Elder Scrolls Online**  
I have developed several [**addons for The Elder Scrolls Online**](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/author-52437.html) to improve event tracking and gameplay management.  
Built within the constraints of the game's API, these addons evolved based on player feedback to optimize usability.
